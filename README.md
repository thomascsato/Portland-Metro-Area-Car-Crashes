# Portland Metro Area Car Crashes

This contains the material for a project for my ENVS250 Geographic Infromation Systems class.  I analyzed data from a dataset from the Oregon Metro Regional Land Information System (RLIS) on every car crash in the Portland Metro Area from 2007-2020.  I used methods such as QGIS for my main map visualization and spatial analysis software, R for attribute table statistical analysis, and SQL for basic data aggregation and selection.
