# Portland Metro Area Car Crashes

This contains the material for a project for my ENVS250 Geographic Infromation Systems class.  I analyzed data from a dataset from the Oregon Metro Regional Land Information System (RLIS) on every car crash in the Portland Metro Area from 2007-2020.  I used methods such as QGIS for my main map visualization and spatial analysis software, R for attribute table statistical analysis, and SQL for basic data aggregation and selection.

The car crashes dataset was too big to upload to Github (248,992 KB).  It was downloaded from here:

The car crashes data documentation is found here:
